Movie Manager API (POC of Mean Stack)
=====================================

This is a POC (proof of concept) I am doing to learn the MEAN stack.
Originally this RESTful API was made in Microsoft's Web Api platform.
The client-side is still on Azure (link below).

The application's goal is to keep a list of movies the user watched/wants to watch. It should be usable on mobile with the look and feel of a native app.

Trying to follow these NodeJS best practices:

Started aproximatelly by june 2016.

The Project
------------

On the back-end:
- ExpressJS running over NodeJS, using Mongoose to keep things easy
- MongoDB hosted on Mlab.com
- Hosted on Azure App Service since jun/2025 (until then it was hosted on Glitch)

On the front-end:
- AngularJS 1.5, <s>for a while</s> it will be hosted in Microsoft's Azure
- It uses EcmaScript 6, so a recent version of the browser is required
- Chrome use is recommended
- url: <a href="http://moviemanager.azurewebsites.net/">moviemanager.azurewebsites.net</a>
